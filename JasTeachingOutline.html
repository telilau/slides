<li>Good Greek
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Residents of the mixed Gentile territory of Galilee probably knew Greek quite well.</li>
<li>Sepphoris, a few miles from Nazareth, was a major center of Greek culture</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Focus is on practical Christianity. The goal of doctrine is a godly character and righteous behavior</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>lack thematic unity | sustained arguments and a clear focus on a limited number of issues</li>
<li>exhortation to continue in a certain way of life | exhortation to a new and different way of life (Stowers, <i>Letter Writing in Greco-Roman Antiquity</i>)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>protrespsis is conversion literature.</li>
<li>Malherbe, <i>Moral Exhortation</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Protrepsis is the philosopher's proper mode of exhortation. Together with refutation and reproof, which exposes the human condition […], and teaching, protrepsis does not make an oratorical display but reveals the inner inconsistency in the philosopher's hearers and brings them to conversion.</li>
<li>Paraenesis is "broader in scope than protrepsis." It is "moral exhortation in which someone is advised to pursue or abstain from something." The speaker is not instructing the listener but reminding, using phrases such as "as you know." Other characteristics include compliments for adhering to what is exhorted, encouragement to continue, and examples.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The modern distinction between paraenesis and protrespsis is not held by classical philosophers and they sometimes used the two terms interchangeably</li>

<li>Exception: προσωπολημψία (not found in secular Greek or the LXX). But it is a Christian creation for the Hebrew "to lift the face."</li>
</ul></li>
<li>James' symbolic world is Scripture.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Positive appreciation of the law: perfect law of liberty; royal law; James cites from the Decalogue and insists that all the law must be kept.</li>

<li>Jewish

<li>Positive view of the law</li>

Strong connection to OT, esp. Lev 19 (cf. BECNT). Perhaps, it is better to say that James is adapting an ethical teaching of Jesus, for whom Lev 19 plays a pivotal role. This is also found in the Sermon on the Mount.

Purpose of the letter: Jas 5:19-20 (Davids, <i>A Theology of James, Peter, and Jude</i>)
</p>
<p class="verse">
5:19 My brothers and sisters, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring that person back, 20 remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of their way will save them from death and cover over a multitude of sins.<br />

Thesis: Jas 1:27 (Blomberg)

1:27 Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.<br />

Spiritual wholeness (Moo)
</p>
<p class="verse">
4:4 You adulterous people, don’t you know that friendship with the world means enmity against God? Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God. 5 Or do you think Scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he has caused to dwell in us? 6 But he gives us more grace. That is why Scripture says:<br />
<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;“God opposes the proud<br />
&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;&#xa0;but shows favor to the humble.”<br />
<br />
7 Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 8 Come near to God and he will come near to you. Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded. 9 Grieve, mourn and wail. Change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom. 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up.<br />

<li>James could be addressing Gentile Christians. Among pagans, the connection between religion and ethics could be loose.</li>

<li>Jas 2 appears to cohere with covenantal nomism
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Christian life begins with grace (1:18, "he chose to give us birth through the word of truth")</li>
<li>Yet, James insist that final salvation, deliverance in the judgment of God (i.e. justification in Jas 2) takes into account one's works.</li>
<li>Consequently, we have the pattern of covenantal nomism reinterpreted in the new covenant
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One gets into relationship with God by faith in Christ</li>
<li>But, one stays in that relationship through obedience to the royal law.</li>
<li>In essence, we have a synergistic understanding of James' soteriology.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Variegated Judaism
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To claim that 2nd temple Judaism demonstrates the pattern of covenantal nomism fails to recognize its diversity. I affirm that many Jews, perhaps the majority of Jews, were more legalistic than the picture presented by Sanders.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Getting in" and "staying in" cannot be directly applied to the issue of salvation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While "getting in" and "staying in" may be valid for covenantal status, it doesn't directly apply to salvation
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>"Getting in" as applied to salvation: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While "getting in" is of grace indeed, it also requires a definite commitment, repentance, and faith, on the part of the beneficiaries</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"Staying in" as applied to salvation: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If those who "stay in" are to show works, their perseverance is the fruit of grace, their willing and doing is God's doing ("for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose"; Phil 2:13).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We should remember that belonging to the covenant (in the sense of being born a Jew) was not a guarantee of salvation. Jews viewed salvation as a final decision made by God at judgment.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Synergism
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>God's grace was necessary for salvation, but the individual Jew still had to obey the law in order to be saved.</li>
<li>In other words, Second Temple Jewish soteriology was synergistic. Humans, through obedience to the law, cooperate with God's grace in order to attain salvation.</li>

<li>works (James) | works of the law (Paul). 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>works (James) = anything done in service to God</li>
<li>works of the law (Paul) = ceremonial practices of the Jewish faith; those works concerned with separating the pure from the impure (as seen in 4QMMT)  | *works in a Jewish context, i.e. subset of the larger category of works (compare Rom 3:28 with Rom 4:1–8). In essence, Rom 3:28 excludes works of any kind from justification.</li>
<li>Conclusion: works (James) is fundamentally similar to works of the law (Paul)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>*faith alone (James) | faith (Paul)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The use of faith alone shows clearly that James is referring to the bogus faith that he has been attacking throughout this paragraph: a faith that someone claims to have (2:14), a faith that is dead (2:17, 26) and useless (2:20).</li>
<li>This is not the faith that Paul intends. He teaches that faith is a dynamic, powerful force, through which the believer is intimately united with Christ, his Lord. And since faith is in a Lord, the need for obedience to follow from faith is part of the meaning of the word for Paul. He can therefore speak of “the obedience of faith” (Rom 1:5) and say that it is “faith working through love” that matters in Christ (Gal 5:6). This is the same kind of faith that James is promoting in this paragraph.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>*justify (James) | justify (Paul) 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Problem (apparent contradiction): works are a necessary basis or means for justification (James) | works have no place in justification (Paul).</li>
<li>Justify (Paul): initial declaration of a sinner’s innocence before God</li>
<li>Justify (James): ultimate verdict of innocence pronounced over a person at the last judgment.</li>
<li>Conclusion: both use justify differently. But they are complementary. “If a sinner can get into relationship with God only by faith (Paul), the ultimate validation of that relationship takes into account the works that true faith must inevitably produce (James).”</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Witherington
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If we take the vindication in Jas 2:24 as referring to the final verdict of God on one’s deeds and life work, then even Paul can be said to have agreed. He even speaks of a final justification/vindication that is dependent on what believers do in the interim (Gal 5:5–6). This final vindication is in view here. Paul would agree that one cannot be righteous on that last day without having done some good deeds between the new birth and that last day in the spiritual pilgrimage.</li>

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org92057cd">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Paul: Uses Gen 15:6 to show that Abraham, and people generally, are justified by faith and not by works
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Paul uses the chronological placement of Gen 15:6 as evidence that Abraham's initial declaration of righteousness was attained solely on the basis of faith.</li>
<li>Appeals to Gen 15:6 to prove that Abraham's faith <i>was credited</i> to him for righteousness, <i>before</i> he had done works, <i>before</i> he was circumcised.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>James: Uses Gen 15:6 as a descriptor of Abraham's life as a whole
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>James' use of Gen 15:6 does not focus on the <i>timing</i>, but the <i>fact</i> of the declaration of righteousness. Thus, the concern of Paul (that Abraham was declared righteous before he had done works) is not central to James. Rather, James uses Gen 15:6 as a description of Abraham's life generally. The sequence of Gen 15 followed by Gen 22 then suggests that Abraham's faith (15:6) found its ultimate significance and meaning in Abraham's life of obedience (Gen 22). In other words, Gen 15 finds its fulfillment (ἐπληρώθη ἡ γραφὴ; 2:23) or ultimate significance in Gen 22.</li>

<h4 id="org18276bd"><i>Wisdom</i> through prayer (1:5–8)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org18276bd">
<p class="verse">
1:5 If any of you lacks wisdom (λείπεται σοφίας), you should ask God, who gives generously (ἁπλῶς) to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you. 6 But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt (ἐν πίστει μηδὲν διακρινόμενος), because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind. 7 That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord. 8 Such a person is double-minded (δίψυχος) and unstable (ἀκατάστατος) in all they do.<br />
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>lacks wisdom (λείπεται σοφίας): 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>wisdom: Means by which the godly discern and carry out the will of God.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Generally, it is skill at life, particularly the ability to make sound judgments and speak the right words. The wisdom of James is not skill in life, but the divinely given ability to live in a godly way (see Jas 3) and to endure testing. It is not the wisdom of earthly success; it is the wisdom tied up with the ability to live the life of faith (BECNT).</li>
<li>In later OT and Jewish wisdom literature, wisdom is sometimes hypostatized almost as though it were a person (a process begun in Prov 8:22–31). In Sir 24, it is almost identified with God’s Spirit, and at times James seems virtually to speak of wisdom the way that Paul would speak of God’s Spirit (BECNT).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>who gives generously
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The fact that wisdom is given does not mean that human activity is not uninvolved. We look to God for our daily bread, but daily bread is also linked to work. As there is a link between working and having bread, there is a link between struggling to understand and obtaining wisdom. But this does not alter the fact that wisdom is a gift (BECNT).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>you must believe and not doubt
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Doubt can be misunderstood, because in English parlance it means any uncertainty or questioning. But James does not mean never have a measure of uncertainty regarding whether something is God’s will; rather he is condemning a lack of commitment, a divided loyalty, or an indecision or hesitancy that questions the integrity of God. Thus, the command “to doubt nothing” does not mean that one should believe everything anyone says; it means that one should in no way hold back from commitment or divide one’s loyalties. James tells his readers they must wholeheartedly and single-mindely trust his character and promises. (BECNT)</li>
<li>Doubt: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The doubt that we are to avoid is not uncertainty about the <i>contents</i> of his will. The precise contents are often unknown to us. The true prayer of faith (5:15) is by definition the one that acknowledges “if the Lord wills” (4:15). The doubt we must banish is that which questions whether God is the one to whom we are ultimately loyal, to whom we pledge allegiance.</li>
<li>It doesn’t mean that we never question what God gives them; rather, we should not doubt the character of God as one who gives generously. See Acts 2:12; Mark 9:24. (ZECNT)</li>
<li>The problem is not the amount of confidence the petitioner has when he utters his prayer. Rather, the person does not have confidence in the nature of God generally. This is contra the “name-it-and-claim-it” heresy.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Moo
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The word διακρίνω in the middle sense (dispute with oneself) probably refers to a basic division within the believer that brings about wavering and inconsistency of attitude towards God.The word διακρίνω was used of Abraham. Paul says that he “did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of God.” But Abraham did waver once, greeting God’s promise about his son with laughter (Gen 17:15–18). Paul’s point is not that Abraham never ever doubted, but that he displayed over many years a consistency in his faith in God.</li>
<li>Similarly, James is not claiming that prayers will never be answered when any degree of doubt exists—for some degree of doubt is almost inevitable in our present state of weakness. Rather, he wants us to know that God responds to our prayers when our lives reflect a basic consistency of purpose and intent: a spiritual integrity.</li>

<h4 id="org701f1ac"><i>Riches and Poverty</i> (1:9–11)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org701f1ac">
<p class="verse">
1:9 Believers in humble circumstances (ὁ ταπεινὸς) ought to take pride in their high position (ἐν τῷ ὕψει αὐτοῦ). 10 But the rich should take pride in their humiliation—since (ὅτι) they will pass away like a wild flower (ὡς ἄνθος χόρτου παρελεύσεται). 11 For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way (οὕτως), the rich will fade away (μαρανθήσεται) even while they go about their business.<br />
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Who is the rich person?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Christian: James is exhorting the brother not to take pride in his wealth but in his identification with Christ—that which would be in a low position in the world’s eyes.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reason for rich Christian: The rich (ὁ πλούσιος) seems to an adjectival modifier like the poor (ὁ ταπεινὸς). Thus, the rich here is a Christian.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Non-Christian: James uses scornful irony. Go ahead and boast. All you have to boast about is the eschatological humiliation that is coming to you in the judgment—the condemnation. Reasons:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>James is influenced by biblical tradition that associates the godly person with humble circumstances. This antithesis is seen in Jesus who pronounces a blessing on the poor but utters a woe on the rich (Luke 6:23–24). Note also that it is poor Lazarus who finds blessings in the afterlife, but not the rich man (Luke 16:19–31). Thus, some consider the rich here to be a non-Christian.</li>
<li>Moreover, James mentions “rich” people in 2 other paragraphs, and both present them as wicked oppressors of God’s people. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>James later states that it is the poor in worldly things who are heirs of the kingdom (2:5) and the rich appear in the role of enemies (2:6), who even blaspheme the name of Christ and are fat for slaughter because they oppress the poor (5:1–6).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Not clear, but I lean towards “Christian” since the irony needed for the “non-Christian” interpretation is not that clear (Moo).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thus, James exhorts both poor and rich believers to look at their spiritual identity as the measure of their ultimate significance.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The poor believer, tempted to feel insignificant and powerless by a world that values power, should take pride in their exalted status in the heavenly realm as one seated with Christ in the heavenlies.</li>
<li>The rich believer, tempted to think too much of themselves because the world holds them in high regard, should not take pride in money or social status. These are doomed to fade away forever. Rather, they should take pride in their humble status as those who identify themselves with one who was despised and rejected by the world.</li>
<li>Both the poor and the rich are to take pride in their identity with Christ. But their identity in Christ is seen from different perspectives. For the poor, Christ is the exalted Lord from God’s perspective; thus, the poor can take pride in their high position. For the rich, Christ is the one who was despised and rejected from the world’s perspective; thus, the rich are to take pride in their humiliation.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Main point: The Christian must always evaluate themselves by spiritual and not material standards.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>What’s our response to James’ teaching?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Divest ourselves of as much material prosperity as we can manage.</li>
<li>Ignore James?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dangers of wealth	
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Wealth leads the wealthy to arrogance, pride, and ruthlessness, to faith in themselves rather than to God.</li>
<li>Wealth can lead the poor to envy, sycophancy, and obsequiousness.</li>
<li>But it is not wealth per se. It is the rich person’s attachment to wealth and the poor person’s lust for it.</li>
<li>Thus, wealthy people are to remember the transitory nature of wealth. They are not to get attached to it, not to place confidence in it, not to put their identity in it, and not to put themselves above others. Their one reason for glory is the same as that of the poor: they know, and are known by, a gracious God (Jer 9:23-24).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>23 This is what the LORD says: “Let not the wise boast of their wisdom or the strong boast of their strength or the rich boast of their riches, 24 but let the one who boasts boast about this: that they have the understanding to know me, that I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight,” declares the LORD.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>"the rich should take pride in their humiliation"
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Non-Christian: Ironical, the rich should boast in their final judgment.</li>
<li>Christian: their humiliation comes in acknowledging their dependence on Christ rather than on mammon.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>"For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their business"

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The space that James devotes to this issue indicates that it was a problem among his readers.</li>
<li>Difficulty: What was the actual problem and the situation? 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2:2–3 could fit 2 different situations
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>*Worship meeting: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Weekly worship gathering of the Christian community where the “ushers,” with tacit approval from the leaders, give the best seats to the rich and ask the poor to sit on the floor.</li>
<li>If this is a worship meeting, would they need to be told where to go? 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The rich and poor are not Christians but interested visistors.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Judicial assembly: (ZECNT)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Evidence: 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>legal language (προσωπολημψία, 2:1; διεκρίθητε, κριταί; 2:4).</li>
<li>V. 6 also introduce the comparison with rich persons dragging the poor Christians into court.”</li>
<li>Language of Lev 19:15 supports legal setting. (“Do not pervert justice; do not show partiality to the poor or favoritism to the great, but judge your neighbor fairly”)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Meeting of a Christian assembly to judge the dispute between two of its members. James does not describe the situation with typical language of early Christian worship meetings, and he accuses them of becoming “judges with evil thoughts” (2:4). If so, this kind of informal Christian legal proceeding is what Paul recommends to the Corinthians in 1 Cor 6:1–8.</li>
</ul></li>

<p class="verse">
2:1 My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism (προσωπολημψία).<br />
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>προσωπολημψία:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>From λαμβάνειν πρόσωπον (LXX used to translate Heb, to raise the face).</li>
<li>“to receive the face,” make judgments based on external appearance. James apply it to dress. Note that this is plural in the Greek, suggesting its wide-ranging application—dress, skin, or general physical appearance.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>James’ language (ἐν προσωπολημψίαις ἔχετε τὴν πίστιν …) shows that discrimination against people is inconsistent with true faith in Christ.</li>
<li>Ethics for James is largely a matter of imitatio Dei, (e.g. Matt 5:48). Thus, faith in Jesus Christ will necessarily eventuate in a reflection of the character of Jesus Christ.</li>

<h6 id="org92308f9">3 reasons against partiality (2:5–11)</h6>
<div class="outline-text-6" id="text-org92308f9">
<p class="verse">
2:5 Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith (ἐξελέξατο τοὺς πτωχοὺς τῷ κόσμῳ πλουσίους ἐν πίστει) and to inherit the kingdom (κληρονόμους τῆς βασιλείας) he promised those who love him (ἐπηγγείλατο τοῖς ἀγαπῶσιν αὐτόν)? 6 But you have dishonored the poor.<br />
<br />
6b Is it not the rich who are exploiting you? Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court? 7 Are they not the ones who are blaspheming (βλασφημοῦσιν) the noble name of him to whom you belong (τὸ καλὸν ὄνομα τὸ ἐπικληθὲν ἐφʼ ὑμᾶς)?<br />
<br />
8 If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture (εἰ μέντοι νόμον τελεῖτε βασιλικὸν κατὰ τὴν γραφήν), “Love your neighbor as yourself,” (Lev 19:18) you are doing right. 9 But if you show favoritism (εἰ δὲ προσωπολημπτεῖτε), you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.<br />
10 For whoever keeps the whole law (ὅστις γὰρ ὅλον τὸν νόμον τηρήσῃ) and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. 11 For he who said (ὁ γὰρ εἰπών), “You shall not commit adultery,” (Ex 20:14; Dt 5:18) also said, “You shall not murder.” (Ex 20:13; Dt 5:17) If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.<br />
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Theological: Poor, rather than rich, more often become believers (5-6a)</li>
<li>Pragmatic: The rich are the very class that is persecuting James' churches (6b-7)</li>
<li>Violates law of love: Claim to love one's neighbor is hollow if they discriminate (8-11)</li>
</ol>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Poor: both material and spiritual sense.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Antonym would be "rich" (material sense) + "wicked" (spiritual sense)</li>
<li>How broad should James’ assertion be, that God has chosen the poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Liberation theologians take a very broad interpretation: God chooses only poor people for salvation; wealthy people are excluded. But  … 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this interpretation ignores many NT passages, and also Jas 1:10–11 that includes wealthy people in the church.</li>
<li>it adds as a word “only,” which James himself does not include. James writes to a community that comprises primarily of poor people. For them, it was evident that God chose poor people to be saved. But to infer from the positive assertion about poor people to a negative assertion about rich people is unwarranted.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The poor have lots of practice in relying on God and thus often have a deeper knowledge of God than those who are not so poor.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>royal law
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Torah as fulfilled and expanded by Christ
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Law pertaining to the kingdom of God, with βασιλικόν recalling βασιλεία in 2:5. This then is the sum total of demands that God, through Jesus, imposes on believers: “the whole law as interpreted and handed over to the church in the teaching of Jesus” (Davids). The royal law extends beyond the Mosaic law as fulfilled and reinterpreted by Jesus to include the teaching of Jesus.</li>
<li>Royal law (2:8) and the “law of liberty” of 2:12 hark back to the perfect law of liberty in 1:25.</li>
<li>Refers also to the renewed covenant of Jer 31:31–34.</li>
<li>Implication: They must love their neighbor (i.e. including the poorest people who can offer them nothing) as themselves.</li>

</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>James now appeals to the OT to show a faith that works. Reference is to Abraham’s testing (Gen 22).
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>James’ concern:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>To distinguish between an ineffective and effective faith. Faith without works is not viable and effective, and faith therefore needs works in order for it to be viable and effective.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Paul's concern:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>One’s legal standing before the eschatological tribunal of God.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>He is interested in how God can rightly give a verdict of “just” for a sinner” (through union with Christ) and how one appropriates that verdict and union (through faith, not by works of the law).</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Different concerns between James and Paul
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>James is interested in the legitimacy of active faith, over against the emptiness of an inactive faith.</li>
<li>Thus, James’ concern is different from Paul’s interest in Gal and Rom.</li>
<li>James’ presentation of Abraham and Rahab’s justification is not to show the process by which a sinful human being can obtain the verdict of righteous; rather, it is a part of the argument to demonstrate that faith cannot be divorced from works. His concern is not the ordo salutis, but consistent Christian behavior.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>"considered righteous" (δικαιόω):
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Paul typically uses it to denote God’s initial judicial verdict of “innocence” pronounced over the sinner who trusts Jesus Christ in faith. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>But we cannot assume that James, writing before Paul, uses that word in that way. The use of this verb in the OT, in Judaism, and in the teachings of Jesus show otherwise.</li>
<li>In Galatians, however, Paul sometimes uses the verb to mean “acquit in the final judgment.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Options
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>*To acquit/vindicate in the final judgment  
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>OT: “vindicate in the judgment”: occurs 44x in the LXX, usually in legal settings. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In these passages, God is the judge before whom one pleads his case. Here, it is one’s actual conduct that forms the basis for God’s vindication. E.g., Mic 6:11 indicates that God will not acquit (δικαιόω) the man with dishonest scales.</li>
<li>Here, “men are declared to be in the right on the facts, i.e. because in general or in a specific matter they are upright, and innocent.”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Judaism: maintains the same viewpoint as the OT. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>a person’s δικαιοσύνη is related to correct conduct, as defined by God’s law, and the verdict of justification was pronounced over those who faithfully observed the covenant stipulations. Matt reflects this Jewish usage. Entrance into the kingdom is dependent on commitment to Jesus (“following Jesus”), but “righteousness” is mainly, if not exclusively, the conduct expected of the disciples (Matt 5:20; Λέγω γὰρ ὑμῖν ὅτι ἐὰν μὴ περισσεύσῃ ὑμῶν ἡ δικαιοσύνη πλεῖον τῶν γραμματέων καὶ Φαρισαίων, οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τῶν οὐρανῶν) and “justify” refers to the verdict pronounced over a person’s life at the last judgment, a verdict based on what a person has done. See Matt 12:37 “For by your words you will be acquitted (ἐκ γὰρ τῶν λόγων σου δικαιωθήσῃ), and by your words you will be condemned (καὶ ἐκ τῶν λόγων σου καταδικασθήσῃ)”</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If James uses the verb in this sense, then he is claiming that ultimate vindication of the believer in the judgment is based on, or at least takes into account, the things that person has done. <span class="underline">So, “justify” in Paul refers to how a person gets into relationship with God, while in James it connotes what that relationship must ultimately look like to receive God’s final approval.</span></li>
<li>James begins his diatribe in 2:14 with the question “Can that (workless) faith save him?”
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Assumption: James contrasts a nonworking inactive faith (which cannot save in the judgment) with a work faith (which can save in the judgment); not because faith itself saves, but because it is the kind of faith that God accepts.</li>
<li>In this view, Gen 15:6 (God’s pronouncment of Abraham’s faith as his righteousness and which happened many years prior to the binding of Isaac) is not determinative for James, because Gen 15:6 was simply anticipatory of the later obedience.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Shown to be right, vindicate (ZECNT)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>E.g. Matt 11:19 “Wisdom is proved right by her actions (καὶ ἐδικαιώθη ἡ σοφία ἀπὸ τῶν ἔργων αὐτῆς).” In other words, the existence and value of wisdom are demonstrated in the actions that arise from it.</li>
<li>In this reading, James claims that Abraham was “shown to be right” by his actions: his prior acceptance by God (Gen 15:6), the righteousness that he had already attained by faith, was demonstrated in his deeds of obedience.</li>
<li>This view also finds support if you consider “show” in v. 18 to be “reveal” rather than “prove.”</li>
<li>This view harmonizes with Paul, but …
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>this usage of δικαιόω is rare</li>
<li>the meaning does not fit the context well since the issue is what constitutes the true religion that will survive the judgment of God (1:21–27; 2:12–13) and what kind of faith will save a person (2:14).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The difference between this option and the previous is in the time frame. The previous is vindication at the final judgment; this is vindication (“demonstration of being right”) in the present.</li>

</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>his faith was made complete by what he did (ἐκ τῶν ἔργων ἡ πίστις ἐτελειώθη):

2:25 In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?<br />
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Note // with Abraham

<li>2:25 &#x2026; when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Why did James choose Rahab? 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>There’s a tradition (found in late first-century Christian writing of 1 Clement) in which both Abraham and Rahab are models of faith and hospitality: Rahab welcomed the 3 spies (τοὺς ἀγγέλους) | Abraham also received the 3 men (“angels”). The faith in both Rahab and Abraham may then contrast with the dead faith of the man in 2:15–16 who refuses to give aid to those in need. But why does James not refer to Gen 18 (the 3 visitors to Abraham)? Moo thinks that it is because James wanted variety. In contrast to a famous and celebrated ancestor, Rahab is an obscure Gentile woman of low moral character. Thus, James implied that anyone is capable of acting on his or her faith—whether a patriarch or a prostitute.</li>
<li>Difference between Abraham and Rahab
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Abraham: rich, moral, male, father of the Jewish nation, major figure in society</li>
<li>Rahab: poor, immoral, female, outcast of Canaanite nation, minor figure in society</li>
<li>Implication: Abraham and Rahab form a merism, so that everyone in between them is included as needing to exhibit transformed living to demonstrate the genuineness of faith.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>In Heb 11:31, “By faith .. she did not perish with those who were disobedient, because he had received (δεξαμένη) the spies in peace.” Putting Jas 2:25 and Heb 11:31 together, Rahab’s justification is marked by the fact that she is spared.</li>
<li>James calls the spies "messengers" (τοὺς ἀγγέλους) while Hebrews calls them "spies" (τοὺς κατασκόπους). Is James’ use indicative that these messengers were the means Rahab discovered more about God and his intentions? (BECNT). BECNT also suggests that there is more evidence how the cord // the Exodus passover.</li>
<li>Issue of Rahab’s lying
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Hierarchical approach to ethics: at times, a more fundamental moral principle must be kept even if it requires disobedience to a more subsidiary one. Here, defending God’s cause was a higher call then responding faithfully to an already doomed regime. 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Similar to Jesus’ weightier matters of the law (Lau).</li>
